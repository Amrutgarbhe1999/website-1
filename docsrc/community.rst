Community
=========

You can get involved in the GeoNetwork project by signing up for a mailing list or finding us on Gitter and StackExchange.

Gitter
------

GeoNetwork has a gitter channel https://gitter.im/geonetwork/core-geonetwork that you can join.

This channel replaces the previous IRC. For a history of previous activity on the IRC channel, search the `archives
<http://irclogs.geoapt.com/geonetwork/>`_.

StackExchange
-------------

`GIS StackExchange <https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/geonetwork>`_ is the only official place to ask for GeoNetwork support, using the ``geonetwork`` tag.

* List of recent questions: https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/geonetwork
* List of unanswered questions: https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/geonetwork?sort=unanswered

Questions that help discover bugs should lead to the creation of bug reports in the GitHub issue tracker.

GitHub
------

The `GeoNetwork GitHub issues tracker <https://github.com/geonetwork/core-geonetwork/issues>`_ is where all bug reports
and feature requests should be done.

There are templates for both uses that *needs to be followed* in order to facilitate
reproduction (for bugs) or assessment (for features).

Please note that anyone creating an issue is considered responsible for maintaining activity
on it, at least while no contributor has been specifically assigned to it. 
This can for example be done by pinging community members, providing additional information or
suggesting fixes.

Issues with no activity in the last 6 months will be automatically closed.
If an issue is really important to you, please help us look for funding to work on it.
