GeoNetwork opensource
=====================
   
GeoNetwork is a catalog application to manage spatially referenced resources. It provides powerful metadata editing and search functions as well as an embedded interactive web map viewer. It is currently used in numerous Spatial Data Infrastructure initiatives across the world.

GeoNetwork has been developed to connect spatial information communities and their data using a modern architecture, which is at the same time powerful and low cost, based on the principles of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) and International and Open Standards for services and protocols (a.o. from ISO/TC211 and OGC).
 
The software provides an easy to use web interface to search geospatial data across multiple catalogs, combine distributed map services in the embedded map viewer, publish geospatial data using the online metadata editing tools and optionally the embedded GeoServer map server. Administrators have the option to manage user and group accounts, configure the server through web based and desktop utilities and schedule metadata harvesting from other catalogs. 

Main features
-------------
* Immediate search access to local and distributed geospatial catalogues
* Up- and downloading of data, graphics, documents, pdf files and any other content type
* An interactive Web Map Viewer to combine Web Map Services from distributed servers around the world
* Online editing of metadata with a powerful template system
* Scheduled harvesting and synchronization of metadata between distributed catalogs
* Support for OGC-CSW 2.0.2 ISO Profile, OAI-PMH, Z39.50 protocols
* Fine-grained access control with group and user management
* Multi-lingual user interface

A single, platform independent installer allows to install and run the software on a PC or a server on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X. The installer can be downloaded as an executable Windows file or as a platform independent .jar installer. It creates a Start menu on Windows computers. Command line installations are also possible for remote installations. Please refer to the manual for detailed installation instructions. 
 
Community and OSGeo
```````````````````

The GeoNetwork community has been expanding quickly over the last years. The current release has been possible because of all those that contributed to the project through code contributions, testing, bug reports and fixes as well as many suggestions.  
 
GeoNetwork is part of the Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo, http://www.osgeo.org) software stack, providing software you can trust tobe free, open and sustainable. Voluntary support is provided through mailing lists, websites and online forums.
