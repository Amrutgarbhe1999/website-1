User meeting 2020 
=================

Camptocamp, Titellus and GeoCat are organising the 2020 Online GeoNetwork Meeting on Tuesday, the 23rd of June, 2020.

The purpose of this on-line meeting is to bring together users and developers of GeoNetwork for a moment of exchange 
around the practices and perspectives of development of GeoNetwork, in particular the version 4, which is a major 
advance with Elasticsearch.

Note that a `recent blog post <https://www.camptocamp.com/actualite/geonetwork-4-0-0>`_ has been published about 
Geonetwork 4.0 alpha.

Regarding the GeoNetwork road map, we are considering three topics for discussion: 

- Improving search capabilities with the move to Elasticsearch

- Making the application more robust & scalable with Microservices

- User interface improvements

Of course, we are looking forward to your suggestions and they will be very welcome. 

As a matter of fact, and in order to facilitate the organisation of this event, we have prepared a survey in order 
to have a better understanding of the way you are using GeoNetwork and of your needs and your expectations.

Therefore we would greatly appreciate it if you could confirm your participation and give us information by filling 
out this form: `https://s.surveyplanet.com/JgerFXD7H <https://s.surveyplanet.com/JgerFXD7H>`_  — as soon as possible. 
It might take 10-15 minutes to complete but your answers will be very useful for designing the best future version. 
The results will be shared among participants. Note that you can skip questions.

Also do not hesitate to pass the information to anyone who might be interested as well.

For more information, do not hesitate to contact frederic.jacon@camptocamp.com.

We are looking forward to meeting you soon!
